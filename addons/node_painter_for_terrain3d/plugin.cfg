description="Edit the Terrain procedualy by adding and moving different Nodes, while no longer having to paint on the Terrain directly. It relies on Terrain3D to work as it only changes the way you can edit the terrain. You may also place foliage in your scene using shapes. Currently only grass-like foliage is supported but further development into that area is underway."
